Hi! I am Samuele Fonio, a PhD student in [Modeling and data science](https://dottorato-mds.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl) at the University of Turin. I am currently enrolled in my third year. Among my research interests there are Representation Learning, Federated Learning, Prototype Learning and in general every kind of learning :smile:.
I am very curious about many aspects of Machine Learning (ML), and eager to know every aspect of it. My research and my interest is more focused on the theoretical aspect of ML, such as methodological research, rather than applications. 

My background is in mathematics, I have a bachelor in pure [Mathematics](https://www.matematica.unito.it/do/home.pl) and a master degree in [Stochastics and Data Science](https://www.master-sds.unito.it/do/home.pl). However, I have always been fascinated by programming, which I met quite late unfortunately. This is why I decided to start this journey in the research world through a PhD.

At the University of Turin, I am more focused on Machine Learning research, but I am part of the awesome Parallel computing research group [Alpha](https://alpha.di.unito.it).

On my website you can find my publications, my interests, my CV, and many other things. Of course, it is still in development, as you may notice from Einstein pictures or data still around. I still need to get used to `al-folio`, but so far it seems very nice :smiley:. Have fun on my website!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
