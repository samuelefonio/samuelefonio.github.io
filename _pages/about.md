Hi! I am Samuele Fonio, a PhD student in [Modeling and data science](https://dottorato-mds.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl) at the University of Turin. I am currently enrolled in my third year. My research focus is about:
- Deep Learning on non-Euclidean manifolds;
- Communication-efficient Federated Learning.  

To tackle these challenges, I am focusing on Prototype Learning and other metric learning methods :smile:.
However, I am very curious about many aspects of Machine Learning (ML), and eager to explore many aspects of it. 

My background is in mathematics, I have a bachelor in pure [Mathematics](https://www.matematica.unito.it/do/home.pl) and a Master Degree in [Stochastics and Data Science](https://www.master-sds.unito.it/do/home.pl). 

At the University of Turin, I am more focused on Machine Learning research, but I am part of the awesome Parallel computing research group [Alpha](https://alpha.di.unito.it)!

On my website you can find my publications, my interests, my CV, and many other things. Of course, it is still in development, and I still need to get used to `al-folio`, but so far it seems very nice :smiley:. Have fun on my website!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
